<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" ><div id="content"> <h2>Preface </h2>This volume contains the papers accepted to the 3rd Asian Conference on Machine Learning
(ACML 2011), following successful preceding conferences held in Nanjing, China and Tokyo,
Japan in 2009 and 2010, respectively. The conference aims at getting leading machine learning
researchers in both Asia and the rest of the world together to discuss their recent research work.
ACML 2011 was held November 13 - 15 in Taoyuan, Taiwan. The conference followed
immediately and was co-located with the 2011 Annual Conference on Technologies and
Applications of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (TAAI 2011). Both conferences shared a joint tutorial
day.
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   The papers in this volume were accepted to ACML following a selective review process. We
had 102 submissions. Among them, 60 successfully followed our full-text submission and
formatting requirement and received full review. We eventually accepted 23 of them for
inclusion in the proceedings. Every paper was double-blind reviewed, initially by at least 4
reviewers who were chosen from our program committee members according to their
bidding results. To ensure the quality, each reviewer had a quota of no more than 4
papers to review. Every paper was also assigned to a senior program committee member
who oversaw the review process by moderating email discussions among reviewers and
resolving their diﬀerences. Finally, the program committee co-chairs or additional reviewers
read borderline papers and reviewers comments to make conﬁdent decisions for all
papers.
<!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   All accepted papers received both an oral and poster presentation. Following the tradition of
previous ACMLs, all oral presentations are plenary. Constraints imposed by the length of the
conference and a policy of avoiding parallel sessions restrict the number of papers that can be
accepted. The poster session allowed us to include 6 additional papers to present at the
conference.
<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   This year, the submissions came from 22 countries around the world. The submissions covered
a wide range of topics, including supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning, clustering
and dimensional reduction, classiﬁcation, ranking, structural learning, learning in graphs and
networks, multi-label classiﬁcation, reinforcement learning and online learning, computational
learning theory, and applications.
<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   In addition to submitted papers, we were excited to have three keynotes. Yann
LeCun talked about Learning Feature Hierarchy. Peter A. Flach talked about Scale
Matters: On the Many Uses of Calibration in Machine Learning and Oren Etzioni talked
about Open Information Extraction at Web Scale. The conference was preceded by a
day of tutorials. The tutorials included Partially Observable Markov Decision Process
by Wee Sun Lee and Learning from Graph Data: Graph Kernels, Graph Mining, and
Recent Developments by Koji Tsuda. We thank them for their great contributions to the
program.

class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Abstract: </span>Information Extraction (IE) is the task of mapping natural-language sentences to
machine-processable representations of the sentences&#x2019; content. IE is often formulated as a
machine-learning problem where an extractor for a particular relation (e.g., seminar
speaker) is learned from labeled training examples. My talk will describe Open IE—an
approach to scaling IE to the Web where the set of potential relations is not known
in advance making a standard machine learning approach impossible. I will describe
various bootstrapping approaches that enables us to utilize machine learning at Web
scale.<br

class="newline" />
<!--l. 112--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Abstract: </span>Intelligent perceptual tasks such as vision and audition require the construction of
good internal representations. Machine Learning has been very successful for producing classiﬁers,
but the next big challenge for ML is to devise learning algorithms that can learn features and
internal representations automatically. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggest that the
perceptual world is best represented by a multi-stage hierarchy in which features in successive
stages are increasingly global, invariant, and abstract. An important question is to devise ”deep
learning” methods for multi-stage architecture than can automatically learn feature hierarchies
from labeled and unlabeled data.
<!--l. 114--><p class="indent" >   We will demonstrate the use of deep learning methods, based on unsupervised sparse coding,
to train convolutional network (ConvNets). ConvNets are biologically-inspired architectures
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
consisting of multiple stages of ﬁlter banks, interspersed with non-linear operations, and spatial
pooling operations. A number of applications will be shown through videos and live demos,
including a category-level object recognition system that can be trained on the ﬂy, a pedestrian
detector, a system that recognizes human activities in videos, and a trainable vision system for
oﬀ-road mobile robot navigation. Specialized hardware architecture that implement these
algorithms will also be described.<br

class="newline" />
<!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Abstract: </span>Calibration is the process of adjusting measurements to a standard scale. In machine
learning it is most commonly understood in relation to the class probability estimates of a
probabilistic classiﬁer: we say that a classiﬁer is well-calibrated if among all instances receiving a
probability estimate p for a particular class, the proportion of instances having the class
in question is approximately p. The advantage of a well-calibrated classiﬁer is that
near-optimal decision thresholds can be directly derived from the operating condition (class
and cost distribution). In this talk I explore various methods for classiﬁer calibration,
including the isotonic regression method that relates to ROC analysis. I will discuss how
these methods can be applied to single features, resulting in a very general framework
in which features carry class information and categorical features can be turned into
real-valued ones and vice versa. I will also discuss an alternative notion of calibration
whereby a classiﬁer&#x2019;s score quantiﬁes the proportion of positive predictions it makes
at that threshold. I will introduce the ROL curve, a close companion of ROC curves
that allow to quantify the loss at a particular predicted positive rate. Rate-calibrated
classiﬁers have an expected loss that is linearly related to AUC, which vindicates AUC
as a coherent measure of classiﬁcation performance (contrary to recent claims in the
literature).<br

class="cmbx-10x-x-109">Abstract: </span>Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a mathematically
elegant formulation for adapting the actions of an agent based on past observations in order to
achieve high expected rewards in the future. However, solving POMDPs is computationally
intractable in the worst case, and until recently POMDPs were considered to be impractical for
applications. In the last few years, tremendous progress has been made in solving POMDPs and
they have been shown to be eﬀective in application domains such as dialog systems, assistive
technologies for the elderly, and aircraft collision avoidance systems. In this tutorial, we will go
through the basic properties of POMDPs, try to understand when they are likely to be eﬀectively
solvable, and describe techniques for scaling to problems with very large state spaces and long
search horizons.<br
