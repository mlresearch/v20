title: Summarization of Yes/No Questions Using a Feature Function Model
abstract: "Answer summarization is an important problem in the study of Question and
  Answering. In this paper, we deal with the general questions with “Yes/No”
  answers in English. We design 1) a model to score the relevance of the answers and
  the questions, and 2) a feature function combining the relevance and opinion scores
  to classify each answer to be “Yes”, “No” or “Neutral”. We combine the opinion features
  together with two weighting scores to solve this problem and conduct experiments
  on a real word dataset. Given an input question, the system firstly detects if it
  can be simply answered by “Yes/No” or not, and then outputs the resulting voting
  numbers of “Yes” answers and “No” answers to this question. We also first proposed
  the accuracy, precision, and recall to the “Yes/No” answer detection."
