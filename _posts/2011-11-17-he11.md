title: Summarization of Yes/No Questions Using a Feature Function Model
abstract: "Answer summarization is an important problem in the study of Question and
  Answering. In this paper, we deal with the general questions with ``Yes√¢\x88\x95No''
  answers in English. We design 1) a model to score the relevance of the answers and
  the questions, and 2) a feature function combining the relevance and opinion scores
  to classify each answer to be ``Yes'', ``No'' or ``Neutral''. We combine the opinion
  features together with two weighting scores to solve this problem and conduct experiments
  on a real word dataset. Given an input question, the system firstly detects if it
  can be simply answered by ``Yes/No'' or not, and then outputs the resulting voting
  numbers of ``Yes'' answers and ``No'' answers to this question. We also first proposed
  the accuracy, precision, and recall to the ``Yes/No'' answer detection."
