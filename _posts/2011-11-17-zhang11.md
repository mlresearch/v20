title: "A General Linear Non-Gaussian State-Space Model: Identiï¬\x81ability, Identiï¬\x81cation,
  and Applications"
abstract: 'State-space modeling provides a powerful tool for system identification
  and prediction. In linear state-space models the data are usually assumed to be
  Gaussian and the models have certain structural constraints such that they are identifiable.
  In this paper we propose a non-Gaussian state-space model which does not have such
  constraints. We prove that this model is fully identifiable. We then propose an
  efficient two-step method for parameter estimation: one first extracts the subspace
  of the latent processes based on the temporal information of the data, and then
  performs multichannel blind deconvolution, making use of both the temporal information
  and non-Gaussianity. We conduct a series of simulations to illustrate the performance
  of the proposed method. Finally, we apply the proposed model and parameter estimation
  method on real data, including major world stock indices and magnetoencephalography
  (MEG) recordings. Experimental results are encouraging and show the practical usefulness
  of the proposed model and method.'
