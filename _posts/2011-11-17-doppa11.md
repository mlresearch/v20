title: Learning Rules from Incomplete Examples via Implicit Mention Models
abstract: We study the problem of learning general rules from concrete facts extracted
  from natural data sources such as the newspaper stories and medical histories. Natural
  data sources present two challenges to automated learning, namely, radical incompleteness
  and systematic bias. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines simultaneous
  learning of multiple predictive rules with differential scoring of evidence which
  adapts to a presumed model of data generation. Learning multiple predicates simultaneously
  mitigates the problem of radical incompleteness, while the differential scoring
  would help reduce the effects of systematic bias. We evaluate our approach empirically
  on both textual and non-textual sources. We further present a theoretical analysis
  that elucidates our approach and explains the empirical results.
