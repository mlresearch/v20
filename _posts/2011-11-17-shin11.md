title: "Mapping Kernels Defined Over Countably Infinite Mapping Systems and
  their Application"
abstract: The mapping kernel is a generalization of Haussler’s convolution kernel,
  and has a wide range of application including kernels for higher degree structures
  such as trees. Like Haussler’s convolution kernel, a mapping kernel is a finite
  sum of values of a primitive kernel. One of the major reasons to use the mapping
  kernel template in engineering novel kernels is because a strong theorem is known
  for positive definiteness of the resulting mapping kernels. If the mapping kernel
  meets the transitivity condition and if the primitive kernel is positive definite,
  the mapping kernel is also positive definite. In this paper, we generalize this
  theorem by showing, even when we extend the definition of mapping kernels so that
  a mapping kernel can be a converging sum of countably infinite primitive kernel
  values, the transitivity condition is still a criteria to determine positive definiteness
  of mapping kernels according to the extended definition. Interestingly, this result
  is also useful to investigate positive definiteness of mapping kernels determined
  as finite sums, when they do not meet the transitivity condition. For this purpose,
  we introduce a general method that we call covering technique.
