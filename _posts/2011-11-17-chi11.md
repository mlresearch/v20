title: "Nonlinear Online Classiï¬\x81cation Algorithm with Probability Margin"
abstract: Usually, it is necessary for nonlinear online learning algorithms to store
  a set of misclassified observed examples for computing kernel values. For large-scale
  problems, this is not only time consuming but leads also to an out-of-memory problem.
  In the paper, a nonlinear online classification algorithm is proposed with a probability
  margin to address the problem. In particular, the discriminant function is defined
  by the Gaussian mixture model with the statistical information of all the observed
  examples instead of data points. Then, the learnt model is used to train a nonlinear
  online classification algorithm with confidence such that the corresponding margin
  is defined by probability. When doing so, the internal memory is significantly reduced
  while the classification performance is kept. Also, we prove mistake bounds in terms
  of the generative model. Experiments carried out on one synthesis and two real large-scale
  data sets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
