title: Learning Attribute-weighted Voter Model over Social Networks
abstract: "We propose an opinion formation model, an extension of the voter model
  that incorporates the strength of each node, which is modeled as a function of the
  node attributes. Then, we address the problem of estimating parameter values for
  these attributes that appear in the function from the observed opinion formation
  data and solve this by maximizing the likelihood using an iterative parameter value
  updating algorithm, which is eÂ¡cient and is guaranteed to converge. We show that
  the proposed algorithm can correctly learn the dependency in our experiments on
  four real world networks for which we used the assumed attribute dependency. We
  further show that the in’uence degree of each node based on the extended voter model
  is substantially diâ\x86\x91erent from that obtained assuming a uniform strength
  (a naive model for which the in’uence degree is known to be proportional to the
  node degree), and is more sensitive to the node strength than the node degree even
  for a moderate value of the node strength."
