title: "Microbagging Estimators: An Ensemble Approach to Distance-weighted Classiï¬\x81ers"
abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) have been the predominate approach to kernel-based
  classification. While SVMs have demonstrated excellent performance in many application
  domains, they are known to be sensitive to noise in their training dataset. Motivated
  by the equalizing effect of bagging classifiers, we present a novel approach to
  kernel-based classification that we call microbagging. This method bags all possible
  maximal-margin estimators between pairs of training points to create a novel linear
  kernel classifier with weights defined directly as functions of the pairwise distance
  matrix induced by the kernel function. We derive relationships between linear and
  distance-based classifiers and empirically compare microbagging to the SVMs and
  robust SVMs on several datasets.
