title: "Multi-label Classiï¬\x81cation with Error-correcting Codes"
abstract: We formulate a framework for applying error-correcting codes (ECC) on multi-label
  classification problems. The framework treats some base learners as noisy channels
  and uses ECC to correct the prediction errors made by the learners. An immediate
  use of the framework is a novel ECC-based explanation of the popular random k-label-sets
  (RAKEL) algorithm using a simple repetition ECC. Using the framework, we empirically
  compare a broad spectrum of ECC designs for multi-label classification. The results
  not only demonstrate that RAKEL can be improved by applying some stronger ECC, but
  also show that the traditional Binary Relevance approach can be enhanced by learning
  more parity-checking labels. In addition, our study on different ECC helps understand
  the trade-off between the strength of ECC and the hardness of the base learning
  tasks.
