title: Mixed-Variate Restricted Boltzmann Machines
abstract: 'Modern datasets are becoming heterogeneous. To this end, we present in
  this paper Mixed-Variate Restricted Boltzmann Machines for simultaneously modelling
  variables of multiple types and modalities, including binary and continuous responses,
  categorical options, multicategorical choices, ordinal assessment and category-ranked
  preferences. Dependency among variables is modeled using latent binary variables,
  each of which can be interpreted as a particular hidden aspect of the data. The
  proposed model, similar to the standard RBMs, allows fast evaluation of the posterior
  for the latent variables. Hence, it is naturally suitable for many common tasks
  including, but not limited to, (a) as a pre-processing step to convert complex input
  data into a more convenient vectorial representation through the latent posteriors,
  thereby offering a dimensionality reduction capacity, (b) as a classifier supporting
  binary, multiclass, multilabel, and label-ranking outputs, or a regression tool
  for continuous outputs and (c) as a data completion tool for multimodal and heterogeneous
  data. We evaluate the proposed model on a large-scale dataset using the world opinion
  survey results on three tasks: feature extraction and visualization, data completion
  and prediction.'
