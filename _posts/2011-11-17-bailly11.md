title: Quadratic Weighted Automata:Spectral Algorithm and Likelihood Maximization
abstract: "In this paper, we address the problem of non-parametric density estimation
  on a set of strings $\Sigma^*$. We introduce a probabilistic model Ã¢\x80\x93 called
  quadratic weighted automaton, or QWA - and we present some methods which
  can be used in a density estimation task. A spectral analysis method leads to an
  effective regularization and a consistent estimate of the parameters. We provide
  a set of theoretical results on the convergence of this method. Experiments show
  that the combination of this method with likelihood maximization may be an interesting
  alternative to the well-known Baum-Welch algorithm."
