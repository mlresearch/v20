title: "Acceleration technique for boosting classiï¬\x81cation and its application
  to face detection"
abstract: We propose an acceleration technique for boosting classification without
  any loss of classification accuracy and apply it to a face detection task. In classification
  task, much effort has been spent on improving the classification accuracy and the
  computational cost of training. In addition to them, the computational cost of classification
  itself can be critical in several applications including face detection. In face
  detection, a celebrating work by Viola and JonesÂ (2001) developed a significantly
  fast face detector achieving a competitive accuracy with all preceding face detectors.
  In their algorithm, the cascade structure of boosting classifier plays an important
  role. In this paper, we propose an acceleration technique for boosting classifier.
  The key idea of our proposal is the fact that one can determine the sign of discriminant
  function before all weak learners are evaluated in general. An advantage is that
  our algorithm has no loss in classification accuracy. Another advantage is that
  our proposal is a unsupervised learning so that it can treat a covariate shift situation.
  We also apply our proposal to each cascaded boosting classifier in Viola and Jones
  type face detector. As a result, our proposal succeeds in reducing the classification
  cost by 20%.
